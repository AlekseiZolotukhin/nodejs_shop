Here is simple node.js shop app with:  
- with user authentication
- csrf form protection
- validations
- middlewares
- handlebars as tpl engine  
- mongodb atlas as data store
- socketlabs.com for email send
- customer cart  

It's not a final version, but just like a little step to next generation :)
